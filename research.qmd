My research focuses on the design, analysis, and performance evaluation of wireless communication systems and networking protocols. I am particularly interested in the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Network Softwarization** to enable the next generation of mobile networks (6G).

## Key Research Areas

### 1. 6G and Open RAN (O-RAN)
We are investigating the "cloudification" of the Radio Access Network. Our work focuses on:
* **Resource Allocation:** Using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for real-time radio resource management.
* **Serverless Networking:** Exploring how FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) can be applied to mobile core functions to improve resiliency.

### 2. Applied Machine Learning in Networking
Bridging the gap between theoretical ML and practical networking constraints:
* **Digital Twins:** Developing high-fidelity network replicas for testing security and performance without disrupting live traffic.
* **Data Privacy:** Analyzing MAC address de-anonymization and developing privacy-preserving mobility data models.

### 3. Performance Evaluation of WLAN/5G
Long-standing expertise in the mathematical modeling and experimental validation of:
* **IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) Evolution:** Performance limits of high-density WLANs.
* **Network Slicing:** Efficiently partitioning 5G resources to meet diverse Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
