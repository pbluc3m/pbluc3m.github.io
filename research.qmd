## Research Vision
My research focuses on the design, analysis, and performance evaluation of wireless communication systems. By bridging the gap between **Control Theory**, **Machine Learning**, and **Experimental Networking**, I aim to build more efficient, resilient, and energy-aware architectures for 5G, 6G, and beyond.

### [6G & Open RAN]{style="color: #003366;"}
Investigating the cloudification of the RAN. We focus on resource allocation using DRL and exploring **Serverless Networking** (FaaS) to improve mobile core resiliency.

### [AI-Driven Networking]{style="color: #003366;"}
Developing **Digital Twins** for network performance and security. We also investigate privacy-preserving mobility models and MAC de-anonymization.

## Active Research Lines

### Network Intelligence & 6G
We are moving towards AI-native architectures where network functions are optimized by "intelligence.". **Focus:** Balancing the performance gain of AI with the reliability constraints of telco infrastructure.

### Sustainable and Energy-Aware Systems
Building on my long-standing work in energy consumption anatomy, we currently research: **Energy-Aware NFV:** Scaling network functions under reliability and power constraints, and **URLLC for V2N:** Sustainable provision of ultra-reliable low-latency services.

### Network Privacy and Security
Using ML to identify vulnerabilities in current protocols, Applying Explainable AI (XAI) to understand behavior-based access control and de-anonymization of random MAC addresses.
