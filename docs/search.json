    "text": "Key Research Areas\n\n1. 6G and Open RAN (O-RAN)\nWe are investigating the “cloudification” of the Radio Access Network. Our work focuses on: * Resource Allocation: Using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for real-time radio resource management. * Serverless Networking: Exploring how FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) can be applied to mobile core functions to improve resiliency.\n\n\n2. Applied Machine Learning in Networking\nBridging the gap between theoretical ML and practical networking constraints: * Digital Twins: Developing high-fidelity network replicas for testing security and performance without disrupting live traffic. * Data Privacy: Analyzing MAC address de-anonymization and developing privacy-preserving mobility data models.\n\n\n3. Performance Evaluation of WLAN/5G\nLong-standing expertise in the mathematical modeling and experimental validation of: * IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) Evolution: Performance limits of high-density WLANs. * Network Slicing: Efficiently partitioning 5G resources to meet diverse Service Level Agreements (SLAs)."
